## Why Use Screenshot Utility over Grab.app?
- **Keyboard control**: Create screenshots without using the mouse (except
  for screenshots which only capture parts of the screen)
- **More options**: Screenshots can be delayed for custom amounts
 before they're taken.
- **Cleaner Screenshots**: Screenshot Utility runs without a dock
  icon. Show your desktop the way it was meant to be viewed.
- **Capture and forget**: There's no need to specify a save location
  every time. The save location only has to be setup the first time the
  app runs.
- **Smaller Screenshots**: PNG images are created instead of TIFFs.

## Why Use Screenshot Utility over keyboard shortcuts?
- There's no need to remember which keyboard shortcut does what
- The save location can easily be changed
- More options

Screenshot Utility also comes with the option to capture the Touch Bar
if possible.
